This directory contains the following:

  * File::Fetch and all dependencies thereof.  File::Fetch is the
    module du jour for downloading software, e.g. CPANPLUS is built
    upon it;
  * Alien::Dojo::Build, an ad-hoc subclass of Module::Build.

None of the above are meant to be installed onto the user's system.
They are here solely to support the build process, including automatically
downloading Dojo from its home site (this is optional).
