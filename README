DESCRIPTION

This is Alien::Dojo, a wrapper module around the Dojo Javascript
toolkit.  Dojo is a visually sexy and well thought-out library for
AJAX programming (aka "Web 2.0"), which is a trendy way of causing
smart browsers to do smart things through Javascript.  See
http://dojotoolkit.org/ for details.

Like all modules in the Alien namespace, this package does nothing per
se; its only purpose is to automatically download, package and make
available a piece of third-party software. See
http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Alien for details.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, you must have Module::Build installed. Type

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

This should download the latest version of Dojo from its home site and
bundle it as a Perl package.  If this doesn't work, or you require a
specific version of Dojo instead of the latest one, manually create a
"download" directory and put the dojo-0.x.y.zip file inside it.
